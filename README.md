# Headbanz

A version of headbanz to facilitate playing over video chat.

### To-do
* Categorize words and allow players to choose categories to include.
* Allow players to add their own words.
* Allow players to specify how many points wins the game. This will likely have to wait until...
* Room functionality! So multiple games can be active at once (with routing?).
* Add some colour...
* Clean up the code now that token auth is in place.
* Add "total word count" line on the intro page to show how many different words are in the game.

### Maybe-do


### Issues
* Have an issue where if a new player joins late, they get a complete word set instead of what words are currently still left to be dealt.

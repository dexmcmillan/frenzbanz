# Frenzbanz

A game similar to Hedbanz made for video chat. A hosted version can be found [here](www.dextermcmillan.com/frenzbanz).

Player-to-player communication implemented using [Ably](https://www.ably.io/). Front end with [Vuetify](https://vuetifyjs.com/en/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

### To-do
* Categorize words and allow players to choose categories to include.
* Allow players to add their own words.
* Allow players to specify how many points wins the game, perhaps in an "options" section.
* Add some colour...
* Add some nicer animations to the cards.

### Maybe-do
* Nothing yet.

### Issues
* Have an issue where if a new player joins late, they get a complete word set instead of what words are currently still left to be dealt.
